I struggled far longer than I would have liked to push the code onto here, turns out it was because git decided to rename "master" to "main". 
It is seeming increasingly unlikely that I will be able to deploy this onto a webhost before the deadline, maybe if I had picked streamlit instead of Gradio it would have been easier. Not only am I still unfamiliar with python, I have never had to concern myself with "secrets"/api keys and how to access these. Also, the code works fine on my machine, but the code on different platforms like "hugging face" seems to struggle to use some of the imported libraries, and I don't really know what the problem is or how to fix it.

Video proving that it works:
